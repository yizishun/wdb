Wave Debugger (wdb) is an innovative debugging tool designed to revolutionize the way software developers analyze and troubleshoot their code. Inspired by the waveform debugging approach commonly used in hardware development, wdb provides developers with a time-based visualization of program execution, allowing them to trace the evolution of variable states across the entire runtime of the program.

Unlike traditional debuggers that rely on breakpoints and single-stepping through code, wdb continuously records the state of variables at each step of the program’s execution. These changes are stored and visualized in a manner similar to hardware signal waveforms, enabling developers to easily explore the dynamic behavior of their code over time.

### Key Features:
Comprehensive Variable Tracking: Records the state of every variable after each instruction or line of code execution, offering a full historical view of how values change throughout the program.

* Ftrace Integration: Utilizes ftrace or similar tracing mechanisms to record function calls, context switches, and other system-level events, allowing for in-depth analysis of both user-space and kernel-space code.

* Waveform Visualization: Provides a graphical interface where developers can explore the “waveform” of variable values, akin to tools like gtkwave for hardware debugging. This allows users to track the evolution of specific variables over time, zoom in on particular events, and correlate variable changes with function calls or other code execution points.

* Selective Recording: Developers can choose to trace specific variables, functions, or modules to optimize performance and focus on the areas most critical to debugging.

* Post-execution Analysis: Unlike conventional debuggers, wdb allows users to analyze the entire program execution after it has completed. This facilitates detailed post-mortem analysis and prevents the need to rerun the program multiple times with different breakpoints.

* Multi-threaded and Concurrent Code Support: Visualize how variables behave in multi-threaded applications, tracking how each thread modifies shared variables and how those changes propagate across the entire program.

Wave Debugger (wdb) is particularly useful for debugging complex applications, including those with concurrent execution, asynchronous operations, or non-deterministic behaviors. By providing a full timeline of variable changes and function calls, it gives developers deeper insight into their code, making the debugging process more efficient and intuitive.

All in all, the wdb will generate a "wave file" at the end of the program execution, which can be opened by a specific waveform viewer.
